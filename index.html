+ Hello, my name is Jon and I currently live in Cardiff, UK. +
+ I am currently in my first year of my A levels studying    +
+ Mathematics, Phyiscs and Computer Science while also       +
+ studying economics, politics, some philosophy, computer    +
+ and electrical engineering in my own time.                 +
+                                                            +
+ I have, since April 2021, taught myself computer           +
+ programming. Specifically, I have self-taught C++, Rust,   +
+ Python, and enough HTML and CSS to build some simple       +
+ websites.                                                  +
+                                                            +
+ Goodreads is an old Amazon-run forum for bookreaders. It's +
+ a great tool to share opinions of books and keep up with   +
+ what your friends or coworkers are reading. I have linked  +
+ my own Goodreads above so you can take a look at what I'm  +
+ currently learning. I also have a reading goal for 2023 of +
+ 40 books so if you have any good reads suggest them to me  +
+ over the Goodreads website.                                +
+                                                            +
